## Microservice
Definition: A small independent service that can be developed quickly.  
- Decoupled: An application is broken down into it's core functions; Each function is a service & performs a single task.

## Monolith
Definition: A Tightly coupled application that runs as a single service. 
- When one process becomes a demand spike, the entire application must be scaled to prevent this process from bottlenecking. 
- Much more complex to add or update features.
